                                <li>Our client want to start a Venezuelan fast food restaurant in Toronto,
                                            Canada.</li>
                                <li>It will be a restaurant specialized in "arepas" that is a food of the
                                        traditional gastronomy of Venezuela and its neighboring country Colombia.</li>
                                <li>Arepas are are made based on ground corn flour. They are circular and flattened
                                        and once cooked, on a metal plate, filled with meat, chicken, cheese, ham, pork
                                        and many other things. </li>
                                <li>Venezuelan arepas restaurants have proliferated in recent years in South America
                                        and now also in Europe, the United States and Canada. </li>
                                <li>Our client want to know if Toronto would be a good place to start their arepas restaurant
                                        and what would be a good location for his business in that city.</li>

                                <li>The restaurant is designed for all public, but it is reasonable to think that
                                Venezuelan residents in the city would be the restaurant's main clients, at least at
                                the beginning of the business.</li>
                                <li> So we obtained data from the estimate of
                                 Venezuelans living in Toronto and theor the immigration figures of Venezuelans in
                                 recent years to this city in the last 10 years.</li>

                        <small>
                            It is expected that potential customers for the business that starts, be Venezuelan
                                and Latin American. Although we do not have the data of distribution of them in the
                                different neighborhoods, we know from the data of Census Profile, 2016 Census Toronto,
                                City, Ontario, Canada, in that country there is a significant population of Latin
                                Americans and particularly of Venezuelans. Venezuela is among the top 10 countries 
                                in the Americas with the largest presence of immigrants in Toronto. Please see
                                tables 1 and 2 at the beginning of the notebook.

                            So our strategy was be to select a cluster, with a number of complementary restaurant options.
                            Fousquare only reported 1 arepa stablishment, located in the vicinity of Chinatown, Grange Park,
                            Kensington Market. So, here is also the recommendation of the location of our client's restaurant
                            in Downtown Toronto. This would correspond to Downtown Toronto, in cluster No. 2.

                        <small>
                                An important aspect is foot traffic because it represents the flow of people who could potentially
                                walk around your restaurant. It would be advisable to be close to a subway station for example.
                        </small>
                        <img data-src="img/subway.png" width="700" height="200">
                        <small>
                                As we determined that the ideal location of the establishment is in the Downtown, and we also suggest
                                that it be close to a subway station, then we could select from the following Neighborhoods:
                                Cabbagetown, St. James Town, Harbourfront, or Regent Park.

                                In principle the project is feasible and it is expected that it will have enough Venezuelan and Latin
                                 American potential clients in Toronto, to start according to the official census of Canada. According
                                 to the results, the recommended location for the arepas restaurant is in the Toronto Downtownr, where
                                 we could locate only a similar business selling arepas. We also suggest that the business be close to
                                 a subway station to make it easier for foot traffic of customers to the restaurant.
